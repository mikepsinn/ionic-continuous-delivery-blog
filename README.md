# ionic-continuous-delivery-blog

This repo is intended to serve as a companion for my blog post: [Continuous Delivery with Ionic, iOS and TravisCI](http://blog.samuelbrown.io/2015/10/20/continuous-delivery-with-ionic-ios-and-travisci/).

Please understand that this is NOT a starter project and does NOT come with everything you will need to start an Ionic project.

It is meant as a reference for how I set up my Ionic project to enable continuous delivery via TravisCI with uploads directly to Hockeyapp.  The `.travis.yml` file is the best place to start to see how everything works together.  From there you can work through the `scripts` directory and the other files.  

The `Gruntfile` is also highly customized but you might be able to find some useful commands so I posted it here as well.
